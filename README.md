# BountyHunters Team FRC 8517
## Overview
This code is a remake of the CTRE swerve module code. The code has been integrated into the command based programming framework.

## Robot 
The robot used for this code is our typical 3 wheel swerve drive using Swerve Xs from WCProducts.net. All motors are Falcon FXs with CANCoders.
A CANivore is used with a PRO license to get FOC out of the motors.

## TODO
To use this code you must understand the and adjust all changes for your system. 
Changes needed that I understand at this point are:
- Add another motor for typical 4 wheel swerve. We are the only fulish team to do 3 wheel swerve.
- Change your drive base length and width.
- Tune your PID variables.
- Change all your CANIDs.
- Debug what I have not tested yet...
